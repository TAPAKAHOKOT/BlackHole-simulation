 Sun[

   


By spectral classification Solar 
applies to type G2V (yellow 
dwarf). Effective temperature 
sun surface - 5780 kelvin. 
Therefore the sun shines 
almost white light but direct 
sunlight surface of our planet 
acquires some yellow shade 
due more strong scattering 
and take over shortwave part 
spectrum of the earth's 
atmosphere (under a clear 
sky with blue scattered light 
from the sky is sunny light 
gives white color again 
lighting).

Mercury[  



Mercury refers to terrestrial 
planets. According to their 
physical Mercury 
characteristics reminds the 
moon. He doesn't have 
natural satellites but there is 
very rarefied atmosphere. 
Planet possesses large iron 
core   being the source 
magnetic field. Core Mercury 
is 83% from the entire 
volume of the planet. 
Temperature on surface of 
mercury ranges from 80 to 
700 K (from -190 to +430 ° C). 
Sunny side heats up much 
more than polar areas and 
back the planets.

Venus[  



Belongs to the family 
terrestrial planets. Venusian 
year is 224.7 earth days. She 
has the most long spin period 
around its axis (243 Earth 
days) among all planets of the 
solar system and rotates in 
the direction opposite 
direction of rotation most 
planets. it the third brightest 
object on the sky of the earth, 
after the sun and The moon 
Planet reaches visible star -
4.6m values - so its brightness 
is enough to cast shadows at 
night. Occasionally venus 
visible to the naked the eye 
and in the daytime days.

Earth[  



Earth mass approximately 
equal to 5,9736 * 1024 kg. 
General the number of atoms 
constituting the Earth, around 
1.3-1.4 * 1050. She is mostly 
iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), 
silicon (15.1%), magnesium 
(13.9%). Internal warmth of 
the planet provided by 
combination of residual heat 
remaining from accretion of 
matter which took place on 
the initial stage Earth 
formations (about 20%) and 
radioactive decay unstable 
isotopes: potassium-40, 
uranium-238, uranium-235 
and thorium-232.

Mars[  

Mars - the planet Earth 
groups with sparse 
atmosphere (pressure at 
surface 160 times less 
earthly). Features surface 
relief Mars can be considered 
impact craters like lunar as 
well volcanoes, valleys, 
deserts and polar glacial hats 
like the earth. Mars has two 
natural satellite - Phobos and 
Deimos (in translated from 
Ancient Greek - "fear" and 
"horror", the names of two 
sons of Ares, accompanying 
him to fighting) which 
relatively small (Phobos - 26.8 
* 22.4 * 18.4 km, Deimos -15 
* 12.2 * 10.4 km) and have 
the wrong form.

Jupiter[  


Theoretical models show that 
if Jupiter's mass was much 
bigger than him real mass 
then this would lead to 
compression the planets. 
However, if Jupiter mass 
exceeded his real weight four 
times the density of the 
planet would rise to such 
degrees that under by action 
increased gravity times the 
measures of the planet 
strongly diminished. WITH 
further increase mass 
compression would have 
lasted until those while in 
progress star formation 
Jupiter wouldn't brown 
dwarf.

Saturn[  


Today it is known that all four 
gaseous giants there are rings 
but Saturn they are the most 
noticeable. Saturn's rings are 
very thin. With diameter 
about 250,000 km of them 
thickness does not reach and 
kilometers Despite impressive 
view amount of substance 
constituting rings extremely 
slightly. If you collect it in one 
monolith, its diameter is not 
would exceed 100 km. On 
images received probes it is 
clear that on really rings 
formed from thousands rings; 
picture reminds tracks 
gramophone records.

Uranus[  


In the depths of Uranus and 
the like Neptune is missing 
with him metallic hydrogen, 
but then there is a lot of ice in 
it high temperature 
modifications. By this reason 
experts singled out these two 
planets in a separate category 
"Ice giants." it the coldest 
planetary atmosphere Solar 
system with minimal 
temperature of 49 K (-224 ° 
C). It is believed that Uranus 
has a complex layered cloud 
structure where water is 
lower layer, and methane - 
top. Bowels of Uranus are 
mainly from ice and rocks.

Neptune[  


In the atmosphere of 
Neptune the strongest are 
raging winds among planets 
Solar system by some 
estimated them speeds can 
reach 2100 km / h. During 
flight "Voyager-2" in 1989 in 
the south Neptune's 
hemisphere was discovered 
so called the Big dark spot 
similar Big red spot on 
Jupiter. Temperature 
Neptune in the upper layers 
the atmosphere is close to -
220 ° C In the center of 
Neptune temperature is 
according to various 
estimates from 5400 K to 
7000-7100 ° C, which is 
comparable to temperature 
on surface of the sun.
